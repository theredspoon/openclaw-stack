# OpenClaw on VPS

This repository contains everything needed to deploy OpenClaw on a single VPS with Cloudflare Workers for observability.

**This project is an experiment** for using `claude code` for devops. A significant effort was made to ensure OpenClaw
is running as securely as possible without limiting capabilities. However, there's no guarantee claude will always follow
the playbooks as designed.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a **[new VPS](docs/VPS-SETUP-GUIDE.md)** and [Cloudflare Tunnel](docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md)
3. Run `claude` in this repo dir, just say `start`

   ```bash
   claude
   # Prompt: 'start'

   # Claude will deploy and test the VPS (15+ minutes)
   ```

### Claude guides you through whole process

1. Asks you for any missing config values
2. Auto repairs any issues encountered with your setup
3. Walks you through openclaw device pairing
4. Runs comprehensive verification and security tests

After deployment, claude can be used to make any changes or manage your VPS with the same prompt.

## Key Features

- **Fully automated deployment**
   — Claude Code runs modular playbooks to set up the entire VPS from scratch
- **Single VPS**
   — gateway, sandboxes, and log shipping all run on one server
- **Cloudflare Tunnel**
   — zero exposed ports, hidden origin IP, no SSL certificates to manage
- **AI Gateway Worker**
   — all LLM requests proxy through a worker for observability & API key management; real API keys never touch the VPS
- **Log shipping**
   — Vector ships container logs to a Cloudflare Log Receiver Worker
- **Host monitoring**
   — cron-based alerts for disk, memory, and CPU via Telegram
- **Automated backups**
   — scheduled backup scripts with cron
- **Browser viewing**
   — view and control agent browser sessions remotely via [noVNC proxy](docs/BROWSER-VNC.md)
- **Ongoing management**
   — use Claude Code for day-to-day VPS operations after deploy

### Security

- **Sysbox sandboxing**
   — agent code executes in isolated Docker-in-Docker containers
- **API key isolation**
   — LLM provider keys stored as Cloudflare Worker secrets, not on the VPS
- **Cloudflare Access**
   — optional authentication layer in front of the tunnel
- **No exposed ports**
   — Cloudflare Tunnel uses outbound-only connections; SSH is the only public port
- **SSH hardened**
   — non-standard port (222), key-only auth, restricted ciphers, fail2ban
- **Two-user model**
   — `adminclaw` (SSH/sudo) and `openclaw` (app runtime, no SSH, no sudo)
- **UFW firewall**
   — only SSH allowed; all other inbound ports closed
- **Docker localhost binding**
   — daemon configured to bind container ports to 127.0.0.1 only, preventing Docker's iptables rules from bypassing UFW
- **Kernel hardening**
   — sysctl tuning and automatic security updates
- **Security audit**
   — built-in `openclaw security audit` checks for misconfigurations; claude runs comprehensive verifications & security checks during deploy

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** - used to deploy and manage the VPS
- **VPS**
  - Minimum: 4GB RAM & 2 vCPUS
  - Recommended: 8GB+ RAM & 4+ vCPUS
  - Linux distro with kernel that supports sysbox
    - Minimum: 5.12+ kernel
    - Recommended: Ubuntu 24.04+
  - Root SSH support - claude needs to be able to SSH into the server
- **Cloudflare Account** - for observability workers & Cloudflare Tunnel
- **Domain** - needed for Cloudflare Tunnel, can be a subdomain

## Configuration

### Step 1: Set Up VPS

Any VPS provider can be used as long as they meet the minimum requirements.

Follow the detailed instructions in **[VPS-SETUP-GUIDE.md](docs/VPS-SETUP-GUIDE.md)** to:

1. Create an OVHCloud (or any VPS provider) account
2. Generate a new SSH key
3. Order a VPS - add your public SSH key during checkout
4. Verify SSH access

### Step 2: Create Config Env File

Clone this repo first if you haven't already.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:simple10/claudiusmaximus.git openclaw-vps
cd openclaw-vps
```

Create your openclaw-config.env

```bash
cp openclaw-config.env.example openclaw-config.env
```

Add your VPS IP and other values to the config file.

### Step 2.1: Configure AI Gateway & Keys

The AI Gateway Worker proxies all LLM requests through Cloudflare. Real provider API keys are configured as Worker secrets (via `wrangler secret put`) and never stored on the VPS.

- [ ] **AI Gateway Worker URL**: Deploy the Worker first (see `playbooks/01-workers.md`), then set `AI_GATEWAY_WORKER_URL`
- [ ] **AI Gateway Auth Token**: Set `AI_GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN` to the Worker's `AUTH_TOKEN` secret
- [ ] **Telegram Bot Token** (optional): Create via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- [ ] **Discord Bot Token** (optional): From [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- [ ] **Slack Bot Token** (optional): From [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps)

Fill in your actual values in openclaw-config.env.

### Step 2.2: Set Domain

Update `openclaw-config.env` with your domain:

```bash
OPENCLAW_DOMAIN=openclaw.example.com
```

### Step 2.3: Create Cloudflare Tunnel Token

Cloudflare Tunnel is used for networking — no certificates needed, no ports exposed.

1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) → **Zero Trust** → **Networks** → **Tunnels**
2. Click **Create a tunnel** → Choose **Cloudflared**
3. Name it (e.g., `openclaw`)
4. Copy the **tunnel token** (long base64 string starting with `ey...`)
5. **Skip** the public hostname configuration — save the tunnel without routes (the domain is connected later, after Cloudflare Access is set up)
6. Add the token to `openclaw-config.env`:

   ```bash
   CF_TUNNEL_TOKEN=eyJhIjoiYWJj...
   ```

See [docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md](docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md) for detailed instructions.

### Step 3: Deploy with Claude Code

You're now ready for Claude Code to automate the rest.

1. Ensure your SSH key is loaded:

   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/vps1_openclaw_ed25519
   ```

2. Open Claude Code in this directory

   ```bash
   claude
   ```

3. Start chatting with Claude

   > start

[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) is configured to start an interview process at the start of a conversation.
For future conversations, you can skip the interview by just asking it to perform a specific task.

e.g.
> Restart the openclaw gateway container

### What Claude Code Will Do During Deploy

Claude runs the various [playbooks](/playbooks/) using values from openclaw-config.env

1. **On VPS-1:**
   - System updates and hardening
   - Create dedicated `adminclaw` user
   - Configure UFW firewall
   - Set up Fail2ban
   - Install Docker + Sysbox
   - Deploy OpenClaw gateway container
   - Set up Vector (ships container logs to Cloudflare)
   - Install Cloudflare Tunnel service
   - Configure automated backups
   - Set up host alerter (Telegram notifications)

2. **Cloudflare Workers:**
   - Deploy AI Gateway Worker (LLM proxy + analytics)
   - Deploy Log Receiver Worker (log capture)
   - Configure Cloudflare Health Check

---

## Post-Deployment: Configuration

**If using Cloudflare Tunnel:** see [docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md](docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md) to finish setting up Cloudflare Access.

Cloudflare Access is the gateway that authorizes users to access OpenClaw through the tunnel.

## Post-Deployment: Testing

Optionally ask Claude to run end-to-end tests:

> Run the tests in docs/TESTING.md using devtools mcp

**DevTools MCP** must already be installed and enabled in Claude Code to allow browser automation tests.

## Post-Deployment: Getting Started with OpenClaw

### Access Your OpenClaw Dashboard

Ask claude to give you the OpenClaw admin URL to start chatting with OpenClaw.

> Please give me the OpenClaw url with the token

The URL should look something like: `https://openclaw.YOURDOMAIN.com/chat?token=OPENCLAW_TOKEN`

This will take you to the OpenClaw web UI where you can start the onboarding process.
If you're using Cloudflare Tunnel option, you'll need to [configure the tunnel](docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md)
before the URL will work.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access OpenClaw

- Verify the gateway token is correct
- Verify networking is correct:
  - Check Cloudflare Access configuration
  - Check tunnel is running: `sudo systemctl status cloudflared`

### Logs Not Appearing in Cloudflare

1. Check Vector is running on VPS-1:

   ```bash
   docker compose logs vector
   ```

2. Check the Log Receiver Worker is healthy:

   ```bash
   curl https://<LOG_WORKER_URL>/health
   ```

3. Check Cloudflare Workers dashboard for errors

---

## Security Notes

- **Two-user model**: `adminclaw` for SSH/admin, `openclaw` for app runtime (no SSH access)
- **SSH uses port 222** (not 22) to avoid bot scanners - always use `-p 222`
- **SSH key-only** - password authentication is disabled
- **Adminclaw user** has passwordless sudo for automation
- Gateway token should be kept secret - it provides admin access
- The `.gitignore` excludes `*.env` and `certs/` by default
- Real API keys stay in Cloudflare Workers (never on the VPS)
- No ports exposed to the internet (Cloudflare Tunnel uses outbound connections only)
