# OpenClaw on VPS

Deploy [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) on a single VPS with Cloudflare for networking and observability — fully automated by [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/claude-code/overview).

**This project is an experiment** in using `claude code` for devops. Claude reads modular playbooks, SSHs into your server, and sets up everything from scratch. A significant effort was made to ensure OpenClaw runs as securely as possible without limiting capabilities. However, there's no guarantee Claude will always follow the playbooks as designed.

## What is OpenClaw?

[OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai) is an open-source AI agent platform. It provides a gateway that manages multiple AI agents, each running in isolated sandbox containers. Agents can use tools (shell, browser, file I/O), delegate tasks to sub-agents, and interact with users through a web dashboard or messaging channels like Telegram and Discord.

This repo wraps OpenClaw with production-grade infrastructure: SSH hardening, firewall rules, Docker-in-Docker sandboxing via [Sysbox](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox), Cloudflare Tunnel for zero-exposed-port networking, and a Cloudflare Worker proxy that keeps your real API keys off the server entirely.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a **[new VPS](docs/VPS-SETUP-GUIDE.md)** and [Cloudflare Tunnel](docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md)
3. Run `claude` in this repo dir, just say `start`

   ```bash
   # Run claude with skip permissions if you want a more automated deploy
   claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
   # Prompt: 'start'

   # Claude will deploy and test the VPS (15+ minutes)
   ```

### Claude guides you through whole process

1. Asks you for any missing config values
2. Auto repairs any issues encountered with your setup
3. Walks you through openclaw device pairing
4. Runs comprehensive verification and security tests

After deployment, claude can be used to make any changes or manage your VPS with the same prompt.

## Key Features

- **Fully automated deployment**
   — Claude Code runs modular playbooks to set up the entire VPS from scratch
- **Single VPS**
   — gateway, sandboxes, and log shipping all run on one server
- **Cloudflare Tunnel**
   — zero exposed ports, hidden origin IP, no SSL certificates to manage
- **AI Gateway Worker**
   — all LLM requests proxy through a worker for observability & API key management; real API keys never touch the VPS
- **Log shipping**
   — Vector ships container logs to a Cloudflare Log Receiver Worker
- **Host monitoring**
   — cron-based alerts for disk, memory, and CPU via Telegram
- **Automated backups**
   — scheduled backup scripts with cron
- **Browser viewing**
   — view and control agent browser sessions remotely via [noVNC proxy](docs/BROWSER-VNC.md)
- **Ongoing management**
   — use Claude Code for day-to-day VPS operations after deploy

### Security

- **Sysbox sandboxing**
   — agent code executes in isolated Docker-in-Docker containers
- **API key isolation**
   — LLM provider keys stored as Cloudflare Worker secrets, not on the VPS
- **Cloudflare Access**
   — optional authentication layer in front of the tunnel
- **No exposed ports**
   — Cloudflare Tunnel uses outbound-only connections; SSH is the only public port
- **SSH hardened**
   — non-standard port (222), key-only auth, restricted ciphers, fail2ban
- **Two-user model**
   — `adminclaw` (SSH/sudo) and `openclaw` (app runtime, no SSH, no sudo)
- **UFW firewall**
   — only SSH allowed; all other inbound ports closed
- **Docker localhost binding**
   — daemon configured to bind container ports to 127.0.0.1 only, preventing Docker's iptables rules from bypassing UFW
- **Kernel hardening**
   — sysctl tuning and automatic security updates
- **Security audit**
   — built-in `openclaw security audit` checks for misconfigurations; claude runs comprehensive verifications & security checks during deploy

### 1. Set up your VPS

Any provider works (OVHCloud, Hetzner, DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, etc.) as long as it meets the [requirements](#requirements). See **[VPS-SETUP-GUIDE.md](docs/VPS-SETUP-GUIDE.md)** for step-by-step instructions.

### 2. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel

The tunnel gives your VPS a public URL without opening any ports. No SSL certificates to manage — Cloudflare handles it.

1. Go to [Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) -> **Networks** -> **Tunnels**
2. Click **Create a tunnel** -> Choose **Cloudflared**
3. Name it (e.g., `openclaw`), copy the **tunnel token** (starts with `ey...`)
4. **Skip** the public hostname step for now — save the tunnel without routes

See [docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md](docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md) for detailed instructions.

### 3. Configure and deploy

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:simple10/claudiusmaximus.git openclaw-vps
cd openclaw-vps

# Create your config file (only VPS_IP and CF_TUNNEL_TOKEN are required to start)
cp openclaw-config.env.example openclaw-config.env

# Edit with your VPS IP and tunnel token
# Everything else can stay as placeholders — Claude will handle or ask you about them
```

```bash
# Make sure your SSH key is loaded
ssh-add ~/.ssh/your_vps_key

# Start Claude Code in this directory
claude

# Just say:
> start
```

Claude will ask you a few setup questions, then run the full deployment automatically.

### What happens during deploy

Claude reads the [playbooks](playbooks/) and executes them step-by-step over SSH:

1. **Cloudflare Workers** — deploys the AI Gateway proxy and Log Receiver (~2 min)
2. **VPS hardening** — creates users, hardens SSH, configures firewall and fail2ban (~3 min)
3. **Docker + Sysbox** — installs the container runtime with security hardening (~3 min)
4. **OpenClaw deployment** — builds the Docker image, starts the gateway and Vector log shipper, builds three sandbox images (base, common with 25+ tools, browser with noVNC) (~15 min on first boot)
5. **Backups** — configures automated backup scripts (~1 min)
6. **Reboot + verification** — reboots to confirm everything auto-starts, runs security audit (~3 min)
7. **Post-deploy** — helps you configure Cloudflare Tunnel routes and pair your first device

Total time: **~30 minutes** for a fresh deployment. Subsequent restarts are much faster since sandbox images are cached.

### After deployment

Claude can manage your VPS on an ongoing basis. Just open `claude` in this directory and ask:

```
> Restart the openclaw gateway container
> Update openclaw to the latest version
> Show me the gateway logs
> Run the security verification
```

## How It Works

OpenClaw uses a multi-agent architecture where a main "coordinator" agent delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents:

```
User message
  -> Gateway (single process, makes all LLM API calls)
       -> Main agent (coordinator, routes tasks)
            -> Code agent (development tools, Claude Code CLI)
            -> Skills agent (gifgrep, weather, web tools, etc.)
```

**Agents are not separate processes.** An "agent" is a configuration profile — a sandbox image, network rules, memory limits, and tool permissions. The gateway process makes all LLM API calls itself and runs tool calls inside the agent's sandbox container via `docker exec`.

### Sandbox isolation

Each agent runs tools inside an isolated Docker container (via Sysbox for secure Docker-in-Docker):

```
openclaw-sandbox:bookworm-slim              (base: minimal Debian + CLI tools)
  -> openclaw-sandbox-common:bookworm-slim  (+ 25 dev tools via Homebrew, npm, Go, uv)
       -> openclaw-sandbox-browser:bookworm-slim  (+ Chrome + noVNC for visual tasks)
```

Sandboxes have read-only root filesystems, no network access by default (only enabled for specific agents), capped memory/CPU/PIDs, and all capabilities dropped. The main agent's sandbox has no network access at all — it delegates network-requiring tasks to sub-agents.

For details on how requests flow through the system, see [docs/REQUEST-FLOW.md](docs/REQUEST-FLOW.md).

### API key isolation

LLM provider API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI) are stored as Cloudflare Worker secrets — they never touch the VPS. All AI requests route through the AI Gateway Worker proxy, which injects the real API key before forwarding to the provider.

```

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Gateway | VPS (Sysbox container) | OpenClaw runtime — manages agents, makes LLM calls, runs tools in sandboxes |
| Vector | VPS (container) | Ships container logs to Cloudflare Log Receiver Worker |
| AI Gateway Worker | Cloudflare | Proxies LLM requests, injects API keys, provides analytics |
| Log Receiver Worker | Cloudflare | Captures and stores container logs |
| Cloudflare Tunnel | VPS -> Cloudflare | Outbound-only connection — no exposed ports, hidden origin IP |
| host-alert.sh | VPS (cron) | Monitors disk, memory, CPU; sends Telegram alerts |

**No ports are exposed to the public internet.** The Cloudflare Tunnel uses outbound-only connections. SSH is the only port open on the firewall.

---

## Requirements

- **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/claude-code/overview)** — the CLI tool that runs the deployment
- **VPS**
  - Minimum: 4 GB RAM, 2 vCPUs
  - Recommended: 8 GB+ RAM, 4+ vCPUs (the gateway, nested Docker, and sandbox images need room)
  - Linux with kernel 5.12+ (needed for Sysbox). Ubuntu 24.04+ or Debian 13+ recommended
  - SSH access with a key (Claude needs to SSH into the server as root initially)
- **[Cloudflare Account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)** (free tier works) — for the tunnel and workers
- **Domain** — any domain or subdomain managed in Cloudflare DNS

---

## Configuration

### The config file

All deployment settings live in `openclaw-config.env`. The example file documents every field:

```bash
cp openclaw-config.env.example openclaw-config.env
```

**Only two fields are required to start a fresh deployment:**

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `VPS1_IP` | Your server's IP address | `203.0.113.42` |
| `CF_TUNNEL_TOKEN` | Cloudflare Tunnel token (from step 2 above) | `eyJhIjoiYWJj...` |

Everything else has sensible defaults or is handled automatically:

- **SSH settings** default to `admin` on port `22` (standard for fresh VPS). Claude changes these to `adminclaw` on a custom port during hardening.
- **Worker URLs** — if left as placeholders, Claude auto-deploys the workers and fills them in.
- **Domain config** — deferred until post-deploy when you set up Cloudflare Tunnel routes.
- **Telegram/Discord/Slack** — optional messaging integrations, leave blank if not using.

### Configuring LLM API keys

After deployment, add your LLM provider API keys to the Cloudflare Worker (not the VPS):

```bash
cd workers/ai-gateway
npx wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npx wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY    # if using OpenAI models
```

These keys are stored only in Cloudflare and never touch the VPS. See [docs/POST-DEPLOY.md](docs/POST-DEPLOY.md) for details.

---

## Post-Deployment

### 1. Configure Cloudflare Tunnel routes

After deployment, you need to connect your domain to the tunnel. See [docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md](docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md) for step-by-step instructions on:

- Adding public hostname routes
- Setting up Cloudflare Access (authentication layer)
- Configuring the browser VNC path (`/browser`)

### 2. Access the OpenClaw dashboard

Ask Claude for the URL:

```
> Please give me the OpenClaw url with the token
```

You'll get something like: `https://openclaw.yourdomain.com/chat?token=GATEWAY_TOKEN`

This opens the OpenClaw web UI where you can start chatting with your agents.

### 3. Remote browser viewing

Agents with browser access run a headless Chrome instance. You can watch and control their browser sessions remotely via noVNC:

```
https://openclaw.yourdomain.com/browser
```

See [docs/BROWSER-VNC.md](docs/BROWSER-VNC.md) for details.

### 4. Testing

Optionally run end-to-end tests:

```
> Run the tests in docs/TESTING.md using devtools mcp
```

Requires [DevTools MCP](https://github.com/anthropics/devtools-mcp) installed in Claude Code.

---

## Day-to-Day Operations

### Managing the gateway

```bash
# SSH into the VPS (port changes during hardening — check your config)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_key -p 222 adminclaw@YOUR_VPS_IP

# Gateway commands (run as openclaw user)
sudo -u openclaw bash -c 'cd /home/openclaw/openclaw && docker compose ps'          # Status
sudo -u openclaw bash -c 'cd /home/openclaw/openclaw && docker compose logs -f'      # Logs
sudo -u openclaw bash -c 'cd /home/openclaw/openclaw && docker compose restart openclaw-gateway'  # Restart
```

Or just ask Claude:

```
> Show me the gateway status
> Restart the gateway
> Show me the last 50 lines of gateway logs
```

### Updating OpenClaw

Updates are done via `git pull` and rebuild on the VPS (the container's `openclaw update` command doesn't work because the `.git` directory isn't inside the container):

```
> Update openclaw to the latest version
```

Claude will pull the latest code, rebuild the Docker image with auto-patching, and restart the gateway.

### Managing sandbox tools

The tools available inside agent sandboxes are defined in `deploy/sandbox-toolkit.yaml`. See [docs/SANDBOX-TOOLKIT.md](docs/SANDBOX-TOOLKIT.md) for how to add, update, or remove tools.

## Security

This deployment implements defense-in-depth with multiple independent security layers:

### Network isolation

- **Cloudflare Tunnel** uses outbound-only connections from the VPS — no inbound ports exposed except SSH
- **UFW firewall** denies all incoming traffic except the SSH port
- **Docker daemon** binds all container ports to `127.0.0.1` only, preventing Docker's iptables rules from bypassing UFW
- **Gateway ports** (18789, 18790, 6090) are only reachable from localhost — external access goes through the Cloudflare Tunnel

### Access control

- **Two-user model**: `adminclaw` for SSH/admin with passwordless sudo, `openclaw` for app runtime with no SSH and no sudo
- **SSH hardened**: custom port, key-only auth (passwords disabled), restricted to `adminclaw` only, modern ciphers (curve25519, chacha20-poly1305), 3 max auth tries, all forwarding disabled
- **Fail2ban**: bans IPs after 3 failed SSH attempts for 24 hours
- **Cloudflare Access**: optional identity-based authentication layer in front of the tunnel

### Container security

- **Sysbox runtime**: provides secure Docker-in-Docker without `--privileged` mode — user namespace isolation maps container root to an unprivileged host user
- **Read-only root filesystems** with targeted tmpfs mounts for writable paths
- **All capabilities dropped** (`capDrop: ALL`)
- **PID limits** (512 per sandbox, 1024 for gateway) prevent fork bombs
- **Memory and CPU limits** prevent resource exhaustion
- **Internal sandbox network** (`172.31.0.0/24`) is marked `internal` — no external connectivity

### API key isolation

- LLM provider API keys are stored as Cloudflare Worker secrets, never on the VPS
- The AI Gateway Worker injects keys at the edge before forwarding to providers
- The VPS only has an auth token for the Worker, not the actual API keys

### Monitoring

- **Built-in security audit**: `openclaw security audit` checks for misconfigurations
- **Host alerter**: cron job monitors disk, memory, CPU, and container health — sends Telegram alerts
- **Automatic security updates** via unattended-upgrades
- **Kernel hardening**: sysctl tuning for IP spoofing protection, SYN flood mitigation, ASLR, restricted dmesg/kptr access

---

## Troubleshooting

### Can't access OpenClaw after deployment

1. **Check the tunnel is running**: `sudo systemctl status cloudflared`
2. **Check Cloudflare Tunnel routes** are configured in the Zero Trust dashboard (this is a post-deploy step)
3. **Verify the gateway is healthy**: `sudo -u openclaw bash -c 'cd /home/openclaw/openclaw && docker compose ps'`
4. **Check the gateway token** matches what's in the URL

### Gateway shows "unhealthy" in Docker

This is normal during first boot — the gateway takes ~14 minutes to build three sandbox images on first start. The Docker healthcheck has a 5-minute start period, so it may report unhealthy while images are still building. Check the logs:

```bash
sudo -u openclaw bash -c 'cd /home/openclaw/openclaw && docker compose logs -f openclaw-gateway'
```

```

Look for `Executing as node` — that means initialization is complete.

### Sysbox installation fails

On Debian, Sysbox may fail with a missing `rsync` dependency. Fix it with:

```bash
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

The playbook handles this automatically, but if you're troubleshooting manually, this is the fix.

### Sandbox build timeout

The first boot builds three sandbox images (base, common with 25+ dev tools, browser with Chrome). This can take 15+ minutes on slower VPS hardware. If it times out, the gateway will still start — sandbox builds are non-fatal. Check the entrypoint logs and re-trigger with:

```bash
sudo docker exec openclaw-gateway /app/deploy/rebuild-sandboxes.sh --force
```

### Logs not appearing in Cloudflare

1. Check Vector is running: `sudo -u openclaw bash -c 'cd /home/openclaw/openclaw && docker compose logs vector'`
2. Check the Log Receiver Worker: `curl https://YOUR_LOG_WORKER_URL/health`
3. Check Cloudflare Workers dashboard for errors

### SSH locked out

If you get locked out after SSH hardening, use your VPS provider's web console (VNC/KVM) to log in with the emergency password that was set during user creation. Then check `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/hardening.conf` for the correct port and settings.
