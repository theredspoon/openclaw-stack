# Deploy Files

Authoritative source files for VPS deployment, organized into three tiers.

## Directory Structure

```
deploy/
  openclaw-stack/     ← Container bind mount (tier 1) → /app/openclaw-stack:ro
    entrypoint.sh       Gateway entrypoint script
    rebuild-sandboxes.sh Sandbox image builder
    parse-toolkit.mjs   Toolkit config parser
    dashboard/          Dashboard web app
    plugins/            Telemetry, coordinator plugins
  host/               ← Host-only scripts (tier 2) — cron jobs, config
    source-config.sh    Config resolver (sources stack.env)
    backup.sh           Backup all claw instances
    host-alert.sh       Host resource monitoring + Telegram alerts
    host-maintenance-check.sh  OS update/reboot checker
    session-prune.sh    Session transcript cleanup
    build-openclaw.sh   Build gateway image with auto-patching
    system-hardening.sh SSH/UFW/fail2ban hardening
    logrotate-openclaw  Logrotate config
  setup/              ← Deploy-time scripts (tier 3) — run once during setup
    setup-infra.sh      Create directories, clone repo
    start-claws.sh      Build image and start containers
    verify-deployment.sh Verify sandbox images, binaries, health
    register-cron-jobs.sh Register cron jobs via openclaw CLI
  vector/             ← Vector log shipper config
    vector.yaml
```

## Convention

When a playbook bash block contains:

```
# SOURCE: deploy/<tier>/<file> → /vps/target/path
```

The executor reads `deploy/<tier>/<file>` from this repo and deploys its contents
to the target path on the VPS. The heredoc body contains a sentinel
`# <<< deploy/<tier>/<file> >>>` as a placeholder.

## source-config.sh Discovery

Scripts source config based on their tier location:

| Script location | Source line | Resolves to |
|---|---|---|
| `deploy/host/*.sh` | `source "$(dirname $0)/source-config.sh"` | Sibling in same dir |
| `deploy/setup/*.sh` | `source "$(dirname $0)/../host/source-config.sh"` | Parent's sibling |
| `scripts/*.sh` | `source "$SCRIPT_DIR/../deploy/host/source-config.sh"` | Fixed relative path |
