# Deploy Files

Authoritative source files for VPS deployment. Playbooks reference these
via `# SOURCE:` comments — never duplicate file contents in playbook heredocs.

## Convention

When a playbook bash block contains:

```
# SOURCE: deploy/<file> → /vps/target/path
```

The executor reads `deploy/<file>` from this repo and deploys its contents
to the target path on the VPS. The heredoc body contains a sentinel
`# <<< deploy/<file> >>>` as a placeholder.

## Files
