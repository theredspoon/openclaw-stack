# AI Gateway Proxy — Configuration Guide

The AI Gateway Worker proxies LLM requests from the OpenClaw gateway to upstream LLM providers. Supports Anthropic, OpenAI, and 11 additional OpenAI-compatible providers (DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, Together, xAI, OpenRouter, Perplexity, Cohere, Fireworks, MiniMax, Moonshot). Provider credentials are stored per-user in Cloudflare KV and managed via the self-service `/config` UI.

The worker supports two upstream routing modes, auto-detected based on which secrets are configured.

See also [Claude Subscription](CLAUDE-SUBSCRIPTION.md) for using OpenClaw with a Claude Code subscription.

## Routing Modes

### Direct API (default)

Requests go directly from the worker to provider APIs (`api.anthropic.com`, `api.openai.com`). This is the simplest setup — just add your provider credentials via the config UI.

```
OpenClaw Gateway → Worker → Anthropic / OpenAI
```

### Cloudflare AI Gateway (optional)

Requests route through [Cloudflare AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) for analytics, caching, and rate limiting. Requires a CF AI Gateway instance and additional secrets.

```
OpenClaw Gateway → Worker → CF AI Gateway → Anthropic / OpenAI
```

The worker auto-detects which mode to use: if `CF_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, `CF_AI_GATEWAY_ACCOUNT_ID`, and `CF_AI_GATEWAY_ID` are all set, it uses CF AI Gateway mode. Otherwise, it routes directly.

## Adding Provider Credentials

Visit the config UI at `https://<AI_GATEWAY_WORKER_URL>/config` and authenticate with your gateway token.

The config page supports four credential types for the legacy providers, plus API key fields for 11 additional providers under the collapsible "Additional Providers" section:

| Provider | Credential | Field | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Anthropic | API Key | `sk-ant-api-*` | Standard API key |
| Anthropic | OAuth Token | `sk-ant-oat-*` | Claude Code subscription token (takes priority over API key) |
| OpenAI | API Key | `sk-*` | Standard API key |
| OpenAI | Codex OAuth | Paste `.codex/auth.json` | Codex subscription (takes priority over API key, auto-refreshes) |
| Additional | API Key | Per-provider | Cohere, DeepSeek, Fireworks, Groq, MiniMax, Mistral, Moonshot, OpenRouter, Perplexity, Together, xAI |

Credentials are stored in Cloudflare KV — they never touch the VPS. Changes take effect immediately.

For Anthropic and OpenAI, OAuth/subscription credentials take priority over static API keys. You can have both configured as a fallback.

Additional providers use `/proxy/{provider}/v1/...` routes (e.g., `/proxy/deepseek/v1/chat/completions`).

## CF AI Gateway Setup

### 1. Create an AI Gateway

1. Go to **Cloudflare Dashboard** -> **AI** -> **AI Gateway**
2. Click **Create Gateway**
3. Note the **Gateway ID** (e.g., `openclaw-ai-gateway`)

### 2. Set the Gateway ID

Edit `workers/ai-gateway/wrangler.jsonc` and set `CF_AI_GATEWAY_ID` to your gateway ID:

```jsonc
"vars": {
  "CF_AI_GATEWAY_ID": "your-gateway-id",
  // ...
}
```

### 3. Set secrets

```bash
cd workers/ai-gateway

# Your Cloudflare account ID (find via `npx wrangler whoami`)
echo "<account-id>" | npx wrangler secret put CF_AI_GATEWAY_ACCOUNT_ID

# AI Gateway authentication token (create in CF Dashboard -> AI -> AI Gateway -> Settings)
echo "<token>" | npx wrangler secret put CF_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN
```

### 4. Redeploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

---

## Verification

### Health check

```bash
curl -s https://<AI_GATEWAY_WORKER_URL>/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}
```

### Test an LLM request (Anthropic)

```bash
curl -s https://<AI_GATEWAY_WORKER_URL>/anthropic/v1/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","max_tokens":10,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hi"}]}'
```

**Expected:** A valid response from Claude.

### Test an LLM request (OpenAI)

```bash
curl -s https://<AI_GATEWAY_WORKER_URL>/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini","max_tokens":10,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hi"}]}'
```

### Test a generic provider (e.g., DeepSeek)

```bash
curl -s https://<AI_GATEWAY_WORKER_URL>/proxy/deepseek/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-chat","max_tokens":10,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hi"}]}'
```

### Verify CF AI Gateway analytics (CF AI Gateway mode only)

1. Go to **Cloudflare Dashboard** -> **AI** -> **AI Gateway** -> your gateway
2. Check the **Analytics** tab for the test requests

---

## Switching Modes

### From Direct API to CF AI Gateway

1. Create an AI Gateway in the Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Set `CF_AI_GATEWAY_ID` in `wrangler.jsonc`
3. Add `CF_AI_GATEWAY_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CF_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN` secrets
4. Redeploy: `npm run deploy`

### From CF AI Gateway to Direct API

Remove the CF AI Gateway secrets — the worker will automatically fall back to direct mode:

```bash
cd workers/ai-gateway
npx wrangler secret delete CF_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN
npx wrangler secret delete CF_AI_GATEWAY_ACCOUNT_ID
```

No redeploy needed — secrets take effect immediately.

## Admin Endpoints

User and credential management is available via admin API endpoints protected by `ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN`:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/admin/users` | Create user with optional creds |
| `GET` | `/admin/users` | List all users |
| `PUT` | `/admin/users/:id/creds` | Replace user credentials |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/users/:id` | Delete user + tokens + creds |

Self-service (authenticated by user's own token):

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/config` | Config UI (no auth — page handles it via JS) |
| `GET` | `/auth/creds` | Get masked credentials |
| `PUT` | `/auth/creds` | Merge-update credentials |
| `POST` | `/auth/rotate` | Rotate token (old tokens expire in 1 hour) |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No API key configured" error

The user has no provider credentials set for the requested provider. Visit `/config` to add them.

### CF AI Gateway analytics not showing

- Verify all three CF AI Gateway values are set: `CF_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, `CF_AI_GATEWAY_ACCOUNT_ID` (secrets), and `CF_AI_GATEWAY_ID` (var in `wrangler.jsonc`)
- If any are missing, the worker silently falls back to direct mode
- Check Worker logs: Dashboard -> Workers & Pages -> ai-gateway-proxy -> Logs

### 401/403 from provider

- Check credentials via the `/config` UI — ensure the correct key type is set
- Verify the provider account is active and has billing configured
- For Anthropic: API key should start with `sk-ant-api-`, OAuth token with `sk-ant-oat-`
