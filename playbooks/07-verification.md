# 07 - Verification & Testing

Comprehensive verification procedures after deployment.

## Overview

This playbook verifies:

- OpenClaw gateway functionality
- Vector log shipping
- Cloudflare Workers health
- End-to-end connectivity
- Security (port exposure, listening services, built-in audit)

## Prerequisites

- All previous playbooks completed
- Cloudflare Tunnel installed (02-base-setup.md section 2.9)
- Workers deployed (01-workers.md)
- VPS-1 rebooted after configuration

## Pre-Verification: Reboot VPS-1

Before running verification tests, reboot VPS-1 to ensure all configuration changes take effect cleanly (especially kernel parameters, SSH config, and systemd services).

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Wait 1-2 minutes for VPS-1 to come back online, then verify SSH access:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ovh_openclaw_ed25519 -p 222 adminclaw@<VPS1_IP> "echo 'VPS-1 online'"
```

---

## 7.1 Verify OpenClaw (VPS-1)

```bash
# Check containers are running
cd /home/openclaw/openclaw
sudo -u openclaw docker compose ps

# Check gateway logs for errors
sudo docker logs --tail 50 openclaw-gateway

# Test internal endpoint
curl -s http://localhost:18789/ | head -5

# Test health endpoint
curl -s http://localhost:18789/health
```

**Expected:** All containers running, health endpoint returns OK.

---

## 7.2 Verify Vector (Log Shipping)

```bash
# Check Vector is running
sudo -u openclaw docker compose ps vector

# Check Vector logs for errors
sudo docker logs --tail 20 vector

# Check checkpoint data exists
ls -la /home/openclaw/openclaw/data/vector/
```

**Expected:** Vector running, no errors in logs, checkpoint files present.

---

## 7.3 Verify Cloudflare Workers

### Log Receiver Worker

```bash
# Health check (no auth required)
curl -s https://<LOG_WORKER_URL>/health

# Test log ingestion (replace with your actual URL and token)
curl -X POST https://<LOG_WORKER_URL>/logs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <LOG_WORKER_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"container_name":"test","message":"verification test","stream":"stdout","timestamp":"2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"}'
```

**Expected:** Health returns `{"status":"ok"}`, log ingestion returns `{"status":"ok","count":1}`.

### AI Gateway Worker

```bash
# Health check
curl -s https://<AI_GATEWAY_WORKER_URL>/health
```

**Expected:** Returns `{"status":"ok"}`.

### Verify Logs in Cloudflare Dashboard

1. Go to **Cloudflare Dashboard** -> **Workers & Pages** -> **log-receiver** -> **Logs**
2. Check for the test log entry sent above
3. Check for container logs flowing from Vector

---

## 7.4 Verify Cloudflare Tunnel

```bash
# Check tunnel service is running
sudo systemctl status cloudflared

# Check tunnel logs for errors
sudo journalctl -u cloudflared --no-pager | tail -20

# Verify port 443 is closed
sudo ufw status | grep 443 || echo "Port 443 not in UFW (correct)"

# Verify direct IP access fails
curl -sk --connect-timeout 5 https://<VPS1_IP>/ || echo "Direct access blocked (expected)"
```

**Expected:** cloudflared active, no auth errors in logs, port 443 closed, direct IP blocked.

> **Note:** External access via the domain (`curl https://<OPENCLAW_DOMAIN>`) is tested in `08-post-deploy.md` after the user configures Cloudflare Access and the published hostname route.

---

## 7.5 Verify Host Alerter

```bash
# Test the alerter script manually (should not send alerts if everything is healthy)
sudo /home/openclaw/scripts/host-alert.sh
echo $?  # Should be 0

# Check cron job is installed
cat /etc/cron.d/openclaw-alerts
```

**Expected:** Script exits 0 with no errors, cron entry exists.

---

## 7.5a Verify Log Rotation

```bash
# Check config is installed
ls -la /etc/logrotate.d/openclaw

# Dry-run test — should show "rotating pattern" for each log file with no errors
sudo logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.d/openclaw

# Optional: force a rotation cycle to confirm .1 files appear
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/openclaw
sudo ls -la /home/openclaw/.openclaw/logs/
```

**Expected:** Config file exists with mode 644. Dry run shows no errors. After forced rotation, `.1` files appear alongside the originals. Log writers (`debug.log`, `commands.log`) continue appending to the truncated files.

---

## 7.5b Verify CLI Pairing

```bash
# Verify CLI is paired and can communicate with the gateway
openclaw devices list

# Expected: command succeeds and shows at least one paired device (the CLI itself)
```

**Expected:** Command completes without "pairing required" errors. At least one device should be listed as paired.

**If it fails with "pairing required":**

Re-run the auto-pairing step from `04-vps1-openclaw.md` section 4.9:

```bash
GATEWAY_TOKEN=$(sudo grep OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN /home/openclaw/openclaw/.env | cut -d= -f2)
sudo docker exec --user node openclaw-gateway \
  openclaw devices list --url ws://localhost:18789 --token "$GATEWAY_TOKEN"
```

---

## 7.6 Security Checklist

### VPS-1

- [ ] SSH on port 222 only (port 22 removed from UFW)
- [ ] SSH key-only authentication (password disabled)
- [ ] Only `adminclaw` user can SSH (AllowUsers directive)
- [ ] UFW enabled with minimal rules (SSH only)
- [ ] Fail2ban running
- [ ] Cloudflare Tunnel running (cloudflared service active)
- [ ] Port 443 closed

```bash
# Verify on VPS-1
sudo ufw status
sudo systemctl status fail2ban
sudo systemctl status cloudflared
ss -tlnp | grep 222
```

### VPS-1 Services

- [ ] OpenClaw gateway running
- [ ] Sysbox runtime available
- [ ] Vector shipping logs
- [ ] Backup cron job configured
- [ ] Host alerter cron job configured
- [ ] Container ports bound to localhost only (not 0.0.0.0)
- [ ] Gateway pids_limit set

```bash
sudo systemctl status sysbox
sudo -u openclaw docker compose ps
sudo docker logs --tail 5 vector
cat /etc/cron.d/openclaw-backup
cat /etc/cron.d/openclaw-alerts

# Verify gateway and bridge ports bind to localhost only (not 0.0.0.0)
# Docker bypasses UFW, so 0.0.0.0 binding exposes ports to the internet
sudo ss -tlnp | grep -E '187(89|90)'
# Expected: 127.0.0.1:18789 and 127.0.0.1:18790 (NOT 0.0.0.0)

# Verify gateway has pids_limit set (prevents fork bombs)
sudo docker inspect openclaw-gateway --format '{{.HostConfig.PidsLimit}}'
# Expected: 512
```

### Cloudflare Workers

- [ ] AI Gateway Worker responding
- [ ] Log Receiver Worker responding
- [ ] Logs appearing in Cloudflare Workers dashboard

---

## 7.7 End-to-End Test

1. **Access OpenClaw** via configured domain
2. **Send a test message** via webchat
3. **Verify LLM response** comes back (confirms AI Gateway Worker routing)
4. **Check Cloudflare AI Gateway dashboard** for the request (Workers & Pages -> AI Gateway)
5. **Check Cloudflare Workers logs** for container log entries (Workers & Pages -> log-receiver -> Logs)

---

## 7.8 Security Verification

Confirm gateway ports aren't externally reachable and the built-in security audit passes.

### External Port Reachability (run from LOCAL machine)

Attempt to connect to gateway ports directly via the VPS public IP. Both should fail/timeout, confirming they're only bound to localhost.

```bash
# Run from LOCAL machine (not on VPS)
nc -zv -w 5 <VPS1_IP> 18789 2>&1 || echo "Port 18789 not reachable (expected)"
nc -zv -w 5 <VPS1_IP> 18790 2>&1 || echo "Port 18790 not reachable (expected)"
```

**Expected:** Both connections fail with timeout or connection refused. If either succeeds, the Docker daemon.json localhost binding is misconfigured — see `playbooks/03-docker.md` for the fix.

### Full Listening Port Audit (run on VPS)

Verify the only externally-bound port is SSH (222). All other listening ports should be on `127.0.0.1` only.

```bash
# On VPS-1: list all listening ports — only 222 should be on 0.0.0.0 or [::]
sudo ss -tlnp
```

**Expected:** Only port 222 (sshd) is bound to `0.0.0.0` or `[::]`. All other ports (18789, 18790, dockerd, etc.) should show `127.0.0.1` only. Any unexpected `0.0.0.0` binding is a security issue.

### OpenClaw Security Audit (run on VPS)

Run OpenClaw's built-in security scanner. This does NOT need device pairing — it performs local HTTP probes inside the container.

```bash
openclaw security audit --deep
```

**Expected:** 0 critical, 0 warnings. 1 info finding is normal. If the audit reports ECONNREFUSED on an unexpected port, check that `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT` in the container's `.env` is set to `18789` (port only, not `IP:port`).

### OpenClaw Doctor (run on VPS)

Run OpenClaw's diagnostic checker inside the container.

```bash
openclaw doctor --deep
```

**Expected:** Only finding should be the Security warning about `lan` binding. No State integrity or Sandbox warnings.

**Expected warning (safe to ignore):**

- **Security: Gateway bound to "lan" (0.0.0.0)** — required for Docker deployments for Cloudflare Tunnel to reach the OpenClaw Gateway. See [REQUIREMENTS.md § 3.7](../REQUIREMENTS.md#37-openclawjson-configuration) for rationale.

**If you see other warnings:**

- **State integrity: missing transcripts** — stale session entries from heartbeat. Clear with: `sudo docker exec --user node openclaw-gateway bash -c 'echo {} > /home/node/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/sessions.json'`
- **Sandbox: base image missing** — the common sandbox build failed. The entrypoint uses a `BASE_IMAGE` override to work around the upstream `USER sandbox` bug (builds a rooted intermediate, passes it to the upstream script). Restart the gateway to retry, then run the sandbox verification in `04-vps1-openclaw.md` to confirm images were built.

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Container Issues

```bash
sudo -u openclaw docker compose ps
sudo -u openclaw docker compose logs -f <service>
docker system df
free -h
```

### Vector Issues

```bash
# Check Vector logs
sudo docker logs --tail 50 vector

# Restart Vector
sudo -u openclaw docker compose restart vector

# Check if Worker endpoint is reachable
curl -s https://<LOG_WORKER_URL>/health
```

### Networking Issues

```bash
ss -tlnp                          # List listening ports
curl -v http://localhost:PORT/    # Test local connectivity
sudo ufw status                   # Check firewall rules
```

### Tunnel Issues

```bash
# Check tunnel service and logs
sudo systemctl status cloudflared
sudo journalctl -u cloudflared --no-pager | tail -30

# Check if DNS resolves to tunnel
dig <OPENCLAW_DOMAIN>
# Should show CNAME to <tunnel-id>.cfargotunnel.com

# Token issues — reinstall service
sudo cloudflared service uninstall
sudo cloudflared service install ${CF_TUNNEL_TOKEN}
sudo systemctl start cloudflared
```

### Service Not Starting After Reboot

```bash
sudo systemctl status <service>
sudo systemctl enable <service>
sudo journalctl -u <service> -f
```
