# Cloudflare Tunnel Setup

Secure OpenClaw behind Cloudflare Tunnel with zero exposed ports.

> **No SSL certificates required!** Cloudflare Tunnel handles TLS automatically.
> You only need a Cloudflare account with your domain's DNS managed by Cloudflare.

## Overview

This playbook configures:

- cloudflared installation on VPS-1
- Tunnel for OpenClaw gateway
- DNS routing through Cloudflare
- Port 443 removal from firewall
- Optional: Cloudflare Access authentication

## Why Cloudflare Tunnel?

| Before (Origin Exposed) | After (Tunnel) |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Port 443 open to internet | Port 443 closed |
| Origin IP discoverable | Origin IP hidden |
| Direct IP access possible | Direct IP access blocked |
| Cloudflare can be bypassed | All traffic through Cloudflare |

## Prerequisites

- Core playbooks (01, 03, 04) completed on VPS-1
- Cloudflare account with your domain added
- Domain DNS managed by Cloudflare
- SSH access as `adminclaw` on port 222

## Variables

From `../openclaw-config.env`:

- `OPENCLAW_DOMAIN` - Domain for OpenClaw (e.g., openclaw.example.com)
- `OPENCLAW_DOMAIN_PATH` - URL subpath for OpenClaw (from openclaw-config.env)

## VPS-1 Setup (OpenClaw)

### Step 1: Install cloudflared

```bash
ssh -p 222 adminclaw@<VPS1_IP>

# Download and install cloudflared
curl -L --output cloudflared.deb https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
rm cloudflared.deb

# Verify installation
cloudflared --version
```

### Step 2: Authenticate with Cloudflare

```bash
# This opens a browser URL - copy/paste to authenticate
cloudflared tunnel login
```

This creates `~/.cloudflared/cert.pem` with your Cloudflare credentials.

### Step 3: Create the Tunnel

```bash
# Create a tunnel named "openclaw"
cloudflared tunnel create openclaw

# Note the tunnel ID (UUID) from the output
# Example: Created tunnel openclaw with id a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
```

Save the tunnel ID for later steps.

### Step 4: Configure the Tunnel

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/cloudflared

# Replace <OPENCLAW_DOMAIN> with your domain
sudo tee /etc/cloudflared/config.yml << 'EOF'
tunnel: openclaw
credentials-file: /etc/cloudflared/credentials.json

ingress:
  # OpenClaw Gateway (web UI and API)
  - hostname: <OPENCLAW_DOMAIN>
    service: http://localhost:18789
    originRequest:
      noTLSVerify: true

  # Catch-all rule (required)
  - service: http_status:404
EOF

# Copy credentials to system location
sudo cp ~/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL_ID>.json /etc/cloudflared/credentials.json
sudo chmod 600 /etc/cloudflared/credentials.json
```

### Step 5: Configure DNS

```bash
# Route your domain through the tunnel
cloudflared tunnel route dns openclaw <OPENCLAW_DOMAIN>
```

**Important:** This creates a CNAME record pointing to the tunnel. In Cloudflare Dashboard, you should see:

- `<OPENCLAW_DOMAIN>` -> `CNAME` -> `<tunnel-id>.cfargotunnel.com` (Proxied)

### Step 6: Test the Tunnel

```bash
# Run tunnel in foreground to test
cloudflared tunnel run openclaw

# In another terminal, verify it works
curl -s https://<OPENCLAW_DOMAIN><OPENCLAW_DOMAIN_PATH>/ | head -5
```

### Step 7: Install as System Service

```bash
# Install cloudflared as a systemd service
sudo cloudflared service install

# Enable and start the service
sudo systemctl enable cloudflared
sudo systemctl start cloudflared

# Check status
sudo systemctl status cloudflared
```

### Step 8: Remove Port 443 from Firewall

Once the tunnel is working, close port 443:

```bash
# Remove HTTPS from firewall (no longer needed)
sudo ufw delete allow 443/tcp

# Verify
sudo ufw status
```

## Cloudflare Access Configuration (Optional)

Add authentication via Cloudflare Access for additional security.

### In Cloudflare Dashboard

1. Go to **Zero Trust** -> **Access** -> **Applications**
2. Click **Add an application** -> **Self-hosted**
3. Configure:
   - **Application name:** OpenClaw
   - **Session duration:** 24 hours
   - **Application domain:** `<OPENCLAW_DOMAIN>`
   - **Path:** `<OPENCLAW_DOMAIN_PATH>/*` (or leave blank to protect entire domain)

4. Add a policy:
   - **Policy name:** Allowed Users
   - **Action:** Allow
   - **Include:**
     - Emails: `your-email@example.com`
     - Or: Login Methods -> GitHub/Google

### Test Access Protection

1. Open `https://<OPENCLAW_DOMAIN><OPENCLAW_DOMAIN_PATH>/` in an incognito window
2. You should see the Cloudflare Access login page
3. Authenticate with your configured method
4. You should now see the OpenClaw UI

## Verification

```bash
# Check tunnel service
sudo systemctl status cloudflared

# Check tunnel connectivity
cloudflared tunnel info openclaw

# Verify port 443 is closed
sudo ufw status | grep 443 || echo "Port 443 not in UFW (correct)"

# Test external access
curl -s https://<OPENCLAW_DOMAIN><OPENCLAW_DOMAIN_PATH>/ | head -5

# Verify direct IP access fails
curl -sk --connect-timeout 5 https://<VPS1_IP>/ || echo "Direct access blocked (expected)"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tunnel Not Starting

```bash
# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u cloudflared -f

# Verify config
cloudflared tunnel ingress validate

# Test tunnel connection
cloudflared tunnel info openclaw
```

### DNS Not Resolving

```bash
# Check if CNAME is configured
dig <OPENCLAW_DOMAIN>

# Should show CNAME to <tunnel-id>.cfargotunnel.com
```

### 502 Bad Gateway

The origin service isn't responding:

```bash
# Check OpenClaw is running
sudo -u openclaw docker compose ps

# Check it's listening on localhost
curl -s http://localhost:18789/
```

---

## Maintenance

### Updating cloudflared

```bash
curl -L --output cloudflared.deb https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared
```

### Viewing Tunnel Metrics

Cloudflare Dashboard -> Zero Trust -> Networks -> Tunnels -> (your tunnel) -> Metrics

### Rotating Tunnel Credentials

```bash
# Delete and recreate the tunnel
cloudflared tunnel delete openclaw
cloudflared tunnel create openclaw

# Update credentials file
sudo cp ~/.cloudflared/<NEW_TUNNEL_ID>.json /etc/cloudflared/credentials.json

# Update config.yml with new tunnel name/ID if needed
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared

# Re-add DNS route
cloudflared tunnel route dns openclaw <OPENCLAW_DOMAIN>
```

## Security Checklist

After completing setup, verify:

- [ ] Port 443 is closed (`sudo ufw status` shows no 443/tcp rule)
- [ ] Port 80 is closed (was never opened)
- [ ] Tunnel is running (`sudo systemctl status cloudflared`)
- [ ] DNS routes through tunnel (`dig <DOMAIN>` shows CNAME)
- [ ] Cloudflare Access is enabled (incognito browser shows login page)
- [ ] Direct IP access fails (`curl -sk https://<VPS1_IP>/` times out or refused)
- [ ] Telegram/Slack bots still work (use outbound connections)

## Dashboard Management

Tunnels can be migrated to dashboard management for easier configuration:

**Cloudflare Dashboard** -> **Zero Trust** -> **Networks** -> **Tunnels**
