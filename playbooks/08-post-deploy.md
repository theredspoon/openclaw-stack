# 08 - Post-Deploy: First Access & Device Pairing

Interactive guide for accessing OpenClaw and pairing your first device after deployment.

## Overview

After `07-verification.md` confirms all services are healthy, this playbook walks you through:

- Configuring Cloudflare Access and connecting the domain
- Retrieving the gateway access token
- Opening the OpenClaw UI for the first time
- Approving your first device pairing request
- Verifying the connection works end-to-end

## Prerequisites

- `07-verification.md` completed successfully
- OpenClaw gateway running on VPS-1
- Cloudflare Tunnel service running (02-base-setup.md section 2.9)
- Browser available on your local machine

---

## 8.0 Connect Gateway Domain via Cloudflare Tunnel

### Check if OPENCLAW_DOMAIN has a placeholder

Read `OPENCLAW_DOMAIN` from `openclaw-config.env`. If it still contains `<example>` or other angle-bracket placeholders:

> "Your gateway domain isn't configured yet. You need to:
>
> 1. **Decide on your domain** (e.g., `openclaw.yourdomain.com`)
> 2. **Configure Cloudflare Access** — see [`docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md`](../docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md) (Steps 1-3)
> 3. **Add a public hostname** to your tunnel pointing to `localhost:18789`
>
> Once done, tell me your domain (e.g., `openclaw.mydomain.com`) and I'll update the config."

Wait for the user to provide the domain. Update `OPENCLAW_DOMAIN` in `openclaw-config.env`, then continue.

### Verify domain is protected by Cloudflare Access

```bash
# Test if the domain resolves — should get a 302/403 redirect to the Access login page
curl -sI --connect-timeout 10 https://<OPENCLAW_DOMAIN><OPENCLAW_DOMAIN_PATH>/ 2>&1 | head -10
```

**If connection refused, timeout, or DNS error:**

The user needs to configure Cloudflare Access and add the published hostname route. Present:

> "Your tunnel is running but the domain isn't connected yet. Before connecting it, you should set up Cloudflare Access so the domain is protected from the first request.
>
> Follow the steps in [`docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md`](../docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md):
>
> 1. **Configure Cloudflare Access** (Steps 1-3) — set up the application, policy, and identity provider
> 2. **Connect your domain** (Step 4) — add the published hostname route in the tunnel config
> 3. **Test** (Step 5) — verify the Access login page appears in an incognito window
>
> Let me know when you've completed these steps."

Wait for the user to confirm before proceeding.

**If the response is a 302/403 redirect** (to a URL containing `cloudflareaccess.com` or `access.` in the `Location` header): Cloudflare Access is protecting the domain. Proceed to section 8.0b.

**If the response is 200** (domain accessible without auth), warn:

> "Your domain is accessible without Cloudflare Access authentication. This means anyone with the URL can reach OpenClaw.
>
> Configure Cloudflare Access now — see [`docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md`](../docs/CLOUDFLARE-TUNNEL.md) (Steps 1-3).
>
> Let me know when done."

Wait for the user to confirm before proceeding.

> **Note:** Do NOT attempt to verify that the gateway is reachable through the tunnel from here. Cloudflare Access blocks unauthenticated requests. The gateway was already verified internally (localhost) in `07-verification.md`. End-to-end browser verification happens in [`docs/TESTING.md`](../docs/TESTING.md) where the user authenticates through Cloudflare Access via Chrome DevTools.

> **Tunnel routing:** The gateway's WebSocket endpoint accepts connections at any URL path,
> but the Control UI client connects to `wss://<host>/` (root path, not the basePath).
> This means the reverse proxy/tunnel **must use catch-all routing** for the gateway hostname
> — path-based routing (e.g., only forwarding `/openclaw/*`) will break WebSocket connections.
> If both gateway and browser VNC share the same hostname, configure the browser path rule
> (`/browser` → `localhost:6090`) **before** the catch-all gateway rule (`*` → `localhost:18789`).
> There is no gateway config option for a WebSocket basePath.

## 8.0b Connect Browser VNC via Cloudflare Tunnel

### Check if OPENCLAW_BROWSER_PUBLIC_URL has a placeholder

Read `OPENCLAW_BROWSER_PUBLIC_URL` from `openclaw-config.env`. If it contains `<example>` or other angle-bracket placeholders:

> "Your browser VNC URL isn't configured yet. You need to:
>
> 1. **Decide on your browser URL** — either:
>    - A subpath on your main domain (e.g., `openclaw.yourdomain.com/browser`)
>    - A separate subdomain (e.g., `browser-openclaw.yourdomain.com`)
> 2. **Add a public hostname** (or path) in your Cloudflare Tunnel pointing to `http://localhost:6090`
> 3. **Protect it with Cloudflare Access** (same Access application or a new one)
>
> Tell me the full browser URL and I'll update the config."

Wait for the user to provide the URL. Then:

1. Update `OPENCLAW_BROWSER_PUBLIC_URL` in `openclaw-config.env`
2. Parse the path component:
   - `openclaw.example.com/browser` → `NOVNC_BASE_PATH=/browser`
   - `browser-openclaw.example.com` → `NOVNC_BASE_PATH=` (empty)
3. Update `NOVNC_BASE_PATH` in the `.env` file on VPS:

```bash
# Update NOVNC_BASE_PATH in .env on VPS
ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "sudo sed -i 's|^NOVNC_BASE_PATH=.*|NOVNC_BASE_PATH=<extracted-path>|' /home/openclaw/openclaw/.env"
```

4. Restart the gateway to pick up the new base path:

```bash
ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "sudo -u openclaw bash -c 'cd /home/openclaw/openclaw && docker compose restart openclaw-gateway'"
```

### Verify browser VNC route is protected

```bash
# Test browser VNC URL — should get 302/403 redirect to Cloudflare Access login
curl -sI --connect-timeout 10 https://<OPENCLAW_BROWSER_PUBLIC_URL>/ 2>&1 | head -10
```

**Expected:** A 302 or 403 response redirecting to the Cloudflare Access login page. This confirms the tunnel route exists and is protected. Do NOT expect a 200 — Cloudflare Access blocks unauthenticated requests.

If you get a connection error or timeout, the tunnel route hasn't been configured yet. Ask the user to add it in the Cloudflare Dashboard.

### Verify novnc-proxy internally (via SSH)

```bash
# Check novnc-proxy is running with the correct base path
ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "sudo docker logs openclaw-gateway 2>&1 | grep 'novnc-proxy'"
```

**Expected:** Log line showing `[novnc-proxy] Listening on port 6090, base path: /browser` (or similar, matching the configured path).

```bash
# Internal check: verify the proxy responds on localhost (inside the VPS, bypasses Cloudflare Access)
ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "curl -sI http://localhost:6090/<NOVNC_BASE_PATH_WITHOUT_LEADING_SLASH>/ 2>&1 | head -5"
```

**Expected:** 200 response with `text/html` content type (the index page).

> **Note:** Full end-to-end browser verification (authenticating through Cloudflare Access and viewing VNC sessions) is covered in [`docs/TESTING.md`](../docs/TESTING.md).

## 8.1 Retrieve Gateway Token

Read the gateway token from VPS-1:

```bash
ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "sudo grep OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN /home/openclaw/openclaw/.env | cut -d= -f2"
```

Construct and present the access URL to the user:

```
https://<OPENCLAW_DOMAIN><OPENCLAW_DOMAIN_PATH>/chat?token=<TOKEN>
```

> **Note:** If `OPENCLAW_DOMAIN_PATH` is empty in `openclaw-config.env`, the URL is simply `https://<OPENCLAW_DOMAIN>/chat?token=<TOKEN>`.

---

## 8.2 Open the URL

Tell the user to open the URL in their browser.

**Expected behavior:** The browser will connect to the gateway. Because this is a new (unpaired) device, the gateway will close the WebSocket connection with code `1008: pairing required`. The UI will show a "disconnected" or "pairing required" message. This is normal.

**If the page doesn't load at all (connection error or timeout):**

1. Check the tunnel is running:
   - `ssh ... "sudo systemctl status cloudflared"`
2. Check the gateway is running: `ssh ... "sudo docker ps | grep openclaw-gateway"`
3. Check gateway logs: `ssh ... "sudo docker logs --tail 20 openclaw-gateway"`
4. Verify DNS is resolving to the correct destination

Ask the user to confirm they can see the page (even with the pairing error) before proceeding.

---

## 8.3 Approve Device Pairing

After the user opens the URL and sees the "pairing required" message, approve their webchat device.

The CLI was auto-paired during deployment (section 4.9 of `04-vps1-openclaw.md`),
so `openclaw devices approve` works directly.

```bash
# 1. List pending device requests
ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "openclaw devices list"
```

Find the `requestId` for the `openclaw-control-ui` client, then approve:

```bash
# 2. Approve the webchat device
ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "openclaw devices approve <requestId>"
```

Tell the user to wait ~15 seconds — the browser auto-retries and should connect.

### If no pending requests appear

- Pending requests have a **5-minute TTL**. If the user waited too long, ask them to refresh.
- Each browser retry creates a new pending request. Use the most recent `requestId`.

### If CLI fails with "pairing required"

The CLI device identity was lost or never created. Re-run auto-pairing:

```bash
GATEWAY_TOKEN=$(ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "sudo grep OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN /home/openclaw/openclaw/.env | cut -d= -f2")
ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "sudo docker exec --user node openclaw-gateway \
    openclaw devices list --url ws://localhost:18789 --token $GATEWAY_TOKEN"
```

Then retry the approval above.

---

## 8.4 Verify Connection

Ask the user to confirm:

1. The UI now shows a **connected** status (no more "pairing required" or "disconnected")
2. They can see the **chat interface** and interact with it

**If still not connecting after approval:**

```bash
# Check gateway logs for auth/pairing errors
ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "sudo docker logs --tail 30 openclaw-gateway"

# Re-list devices to confirm approval went through
ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "openclaw devices list"
```

If the device shows as approved but the browser still can't connect, ask the user to hard-refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) and try again.

---

## 8.5 Reference: Device Management

**CLI commands** (from local machine via SSH):

```bash
openclaw devices list                    # List pending/approved
openclaw devices approve <requestId>     # Approve a device
```

**Control UI:** Once one device is paired, approve new devices from the Control UI.

**Notes:** Pending requests expire after 5 minutes. The browser auto-retries, creating new requests. Refresh the page if a request expired.

**Re-pairing the CLI** (if device identity is lost):

```bash
GATEWAY_TOKEN=$(sudo grep OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN /home/openclaw/openclaw/.env | cut -d= -f2)
sudo docker exec --user node openclaw-gateway \
  openclaw devices list --url ws://localhost:18789 --token "$GATEWAY_TOKEN"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" when opening the URL

- Tunnel is not running, or DNS is not configured correctly.
- Check `07-verification.md` section 7.6 for networking verification steps.

### Token is rejected (401/403)

- The token in the URL may not match `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` in the `.env` file.
- Re-read the token from VPS-1 and try again.

### No pending devices after opening URL

- The page may not have fully loaded or attempted a WebSocket connection.
- Check browser developer console for errors.
- Ensure the URL includes the correct token parameter.

### Device approved but still "disconnected"

- Hard-refresh the browser page.
- Check gateway logs for errors after the approval.
- Verify the gateway container hasn't restarted: `sudo docker ps | grep openclaw-gateway`
